We introduce the model of next-gen villages that efficiently integrates data through smart technologies and automatizes basic agricultural processes.

Using arduino sensors and libraries, we collect ecologically useful information and send to control blocks, which are located on every street of the village. These blocks use filtering algorithms that return changes, then send them to the main server of the village and gives property owners access to the information related to their territory.

We use DHT sensors responsible of returning information on soil humidity, temperature, and heat index. Using this type of information we calculate the community's ecological needs and offer them solutions.

Moreover, we have laser detection system, which we use to detect security issues and to prevent animals from entering and destroying crops.

Finally, we developed earthquake activity detection tools meant to inform citizens about upcoming dangerous events.
